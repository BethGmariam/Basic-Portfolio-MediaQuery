        <h1> About Me</h1> 
        <img src="assets/images/pic.jpg" alt="Profilepicture" class="profile-img"> 
        <p> My name is Beth Gmariam; I was born and raised in Ethiopia. I am energetic, entusiastic to learn new things, specially technology. My passion toward Mathematics and Physics lead me to study Electrical Engineering.
            After I graduated from Elecrical Engineering. I moved to United States of America for a better life and opportunity. 
            I started working at BestBuy Electronics store, as a sales representative while looking for a job in Engineering field.
            I studied the USA Electrical codes/standards and I was able find a job within one year; I worked for Engineering consulting firm in Oakland California.
            In 2013, while working in the company, I took Engineering licensing exam (EIT), I passed the exam with my first try. This was the longest hour exam I have ever taken :) (8hrs). </p> 
        
        <p> In 2015, I joined another Engineering firm in San Francisco. This new company utilizes 2D/3D modeling softwares (Revit, VisualStudio, ...etc). My responsibility, as Electrical Designer,
            was to design and model electrical system layout on those 2D/3D modeling computer softwares.</p> 
        
        <p> In 2017, I got married to my husband who lives in Canada, and I had to move from the state. During this time when I have time to accomplish my coding passion, I decided to attend the BootCamp Programe at University of Toronto (UofT).
            Currently, I am taking a fullstack web development program where we learn coding in different programming languages. 
            In addition to my previous experience of utilizing various softwares, the following are the skills I have related to coding (HTML5, CSS, Terminal/GitBash commands, Git/Github, BootStrap, etc)</p>
